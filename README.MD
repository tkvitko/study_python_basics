<h1>Python learning</h1>

Here you can find my homeworks in "Python basics" course in GeekBrains (online university).<br>
The most interesting works are:
- task_5_5.py - function to get uniq elements from source list (saving its order)
- task_7_2.py - "handmade" yaml parser
- task_10_1.py - class Matrix for matrix math operations
- task_11/equipments/models - "epic" study task about OOP :)
